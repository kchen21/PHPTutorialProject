# PHP Tutorial Project

I created this following Patrick Louys's tutorial on how to create a PHP application without a framework. The project follows the principles of SOLID programming, and uses Error Handler, HTTP Component, Router, Dependency Injector, and Templating Engine libraries that I have installed using Composer.
